				<h3 class="eventTitle">What to expect while working with an Architect</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Initial meeting with Architect</li>
					<li><strong>Measure & Draft Existing Condition:</strong> In order for your architect to provide accurate drawings, they need to measure and verify the existing space and create computer generated drawings to work off of.</li>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Schematic Design Process:</strong> Once the existing conditions are drafted, your architect will then start laying out the new design based on your needs and wants. you and your architect will be in constant discussion throughout the whole design process to fine-tune the final product. even if you do not know what you want, your architect should guide you to best solution.</li>
					<li>Preliminary Estimates: Once you sign off on the final design, your architect will issue a schematic design drawings to contractors to get preliminary estimates. this helps ensure that your project does not go above your budget. once this phase is completed, you have the option of continuing with the scope as is, or scaling it back to reduce the overall construction budget.</li>
					<li>Construction Documents (Permit Set): During this phase, the design is now detailed to become a reality. these drawings are prepared for both permit submission and construction. (producing the drawings)</li>
					<li>Bidding: Once the construction documents are completed the architect will submit these detailed drawings to contractors to get final estimate. these are more accurate numbers and a starting point for negotiation for your final construction cost. in this phase, you select a contractor to hire based on their qualification and their estimate.</li>
					<li>Permit: Once you select a contractor, they will submit for a permit. each town is different in the length of their review process. legally, they have 20 days to review the drawings but it is safe to assume it will be a 3-4 week process. (actual submission of drawings)</li>
					<li>Construction Administration: Congratulations, you are now going to start construction! during this process, your architect will maintain contact with you and the contractor, to ensure details of the design are properly executed.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>8 scary things about home renovation that aren't actually scary</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Opening up a wall: Putting a hole in a wall will not bring down the house. most walls in a house are not load-bearing and can be easily knocked down. if a wall is load-bearing, your architect can design a beam to carry the load and create the opening.</li>
						<li>Painting: A fresh paint job has the power to totally transform the look of your house in less time and for less cash than any other remodeling project.</li>
						<li>Permit Process: Your architect can walk you through the long and confusing process of applying for a permit. a homeowner can submit for a permit without a contractor. towns typically take 4 weeks to review a set of drawings for the permit.</li>
						<li>Condo Association and Bylaws: </li>
						<li>Construction Timelines</li>
						<li>Finding A Contractor: It's always a nice idea to ask friends and family for contractor referral but at the end of the day, your architect is the best resource to find a reliable contractor. your architect has many relationship with different contractors and know their skill level and price range. based on your needs, your architect can guide you through a list of qualified contractors.</li>
						<li>Adding Value To A Property: The kitchen and bathroom are the biggest areas to add value to your home. whether you're looking to move or just moved in, renovating your bathroom or your kitchen is a good place to start.</li>
						<li>Building Codes: Your architect is an expert at maneuvering through the minutia of local codes. most zoning ordinances are available online for anyone to view but your architect can guide you to the right answers. (explain zoning ordinance)</li>
